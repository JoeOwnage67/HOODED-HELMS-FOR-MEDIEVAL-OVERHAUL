**UPDATES**

March 2024:

Hello, I am currently working on testing UNSTABLE 1.5 branch. This is difficult until official 1.5 of Medieval Overhaul is released, but I am making it available in case anyone wants to help test it.

1.4 branch of this mod will not be touched so as not to mess up people's saves.

Please let me know of any feedback or issues so I can try to correct them.

**CHANGES FOR 1.5:**

- I've put some effort into trying to improve my masks, which were not perfect before and showed some white around the edges of the stuffed material. Hopefully they look a bit cleaner now.

- Added proper armor ratings for all helms, so they don't just use the stuffed material armor stats.
